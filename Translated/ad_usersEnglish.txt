I will tell you another moment about ad_users, 
there is a lot of information about employees, 
there you can find technicians, engineers, 
etc. We usually need ad_users when we want to find an admin's wheelbarrow, 
because on admin cars we can find porols from the antivirus console, 
from cloud backups, and so on. Now the skin manual according to the USERCHANTER,
with the help of it, we find these cars. 
Just ad_users we need to take the SID from there, 
for the golden ticket, but more on that later.

1. Make a list of targets 
1.1 We open ad_users, looking for someone there who is potentially interesting to us: 
admin / engineer / information technologists / IT 
we take account logins from sAMAccountName
1.2 Take a list of admin domains
1.3 put in the file list.txt the first and second

2. Aploadim Power View. 
2.1 powershell-import _/home/user/software/powerview/view.ps1_ 
2.1 --comment: import power view from /home/uzer/soft/powerview/view.ps1 
2.3 Rubam hunting 
2.3.1 
psinechti 1884 s64 invoke-user-treads 20 -uzerfile <unk>:programdatalist.tst >> <unk>:programdataout.tstst

instead of 1884 - PID process where we have enough rights to make an injection.
x64 - or x86 bit depth of the process. see in tasklist
In sprogramdatasheet.tht should be a list that we made in point No. 1. 
after 5-10-20 minutes to watch the result in the out.tht. As it finishes immediately replenishes it at once. that is, if the file is 0byte means it works or AB is padded (if you hit av then in kobe you will see)
